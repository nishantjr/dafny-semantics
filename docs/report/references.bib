K is a rewriting-based framework for defining programming languages. K-Maude is a tool implementing K on top of Maude. K-Maude provides an interface accepting K modules along with regular Maude modules and a collection of tools for transforming K language definitions into Maude rewrite theories for execution or analysis, or into LaTeX for documentation purposes. The current K-Maude prototype was successfully used in defining several languages and language analysis tools, both for research and for teaching purposes. This paper describes the K-Maude tool, both from a user and from an implementer perspective.

  title     = {From {H}oare {L}ogic to {M}atching {L}ogic {R}eachability},
  abstract  = {
Matching logic reachability has been recently proposed as an alternative program
verification approach.
Unlike Hoare logic, where one defines a language-specific proof system that
needs to be proved sound for each language separately, matching logic
reachability provides a *language-independent* and *sound* proof system that
directly uses the trusted operational semantics of the language as axioms.
Matching logic reachability thus has a clear practical advantage: it eliminates
the need for an additional semantics of the same language in order to reason
about programs, and implicitly eliminates the need for tedious soundness proofs.
What is not clear, however, is whether matching logic reachability is as
powerful as Hoare logic.
This paper introduces a technique to mechanically translate Hoare logic proof
derivations into equivalent matching logic reachability proof derivations.
The presented technique has two consequences: first, it suggests that matching
logic reachability has no theoretical limitation over Hoare logic; and second,
it provides a new approach to prove Hoare logics sound.
